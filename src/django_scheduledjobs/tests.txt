Scheduled jobs
==============

    >>> import datetime
    >>> from django_scheduledjobs import schedule_job, ScheduledJob

Let's create some jobs:

    >>> dt = datetime.timedelta(0)
    >>> schedule_job(dt, 'django_scheduledjobs.tests.sample_job')

You can pass in arguments to jobs:

    >>> schedule_job(dt, 'django_scheduledjobs.tests.job_with_args',
    ...              args=[11], kwargs=dict(k=12))

You can also bind model objects to jobs.

    TODO: bind to a sample model

Now run the jobs:

    >>> from django_scheduledjobs import run_jobs
    >>> run_jobs()
    Simple job executed.
    Job with arguments: n = 11, k = 12

Completed jobs have been removed so they will not be run again:

    >>> run_jobs()
