About
-----

**django_future** is a Django tool for scheduling jobs on specified times.


-----
Usage
-----

First of all, you need to have **django_future** installed; for your
convenience, recent versions should be available from PyPI.

Use the ``django_future.schedule_job`` function to schedule new jobs:

    >>> from django_future import schedule_job
    >>> import datetime
    >>> schedule_job(datetime.datetime(2010, 10, 10),
    ...              'myproject.myapp.handlers.dosomething')

To run outstanding jobs, use the Django management command 'runscheduledjobs'.

-------
Caveats
-------

The job runner does not do locking.  If you run it while a previous run
is still active, some jobs may be executed twice because of race conditions.

Exceptions raised by jobs will simply crash the job runner with a traceback.

Database transactions are not used for jobs. If you need transactions,
you will have to handle them manually.
